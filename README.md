A simple, clean, and modern desktop application for daily prayer and spiritual reflection.

## About The Project

The Prayerbook App was built to provide a distraction-free way to access a curated collection of 24 written prayers. It is designed with simplicity and reverence in mind—like a digital prayer book.

This app uses the same technology stack as the Journal and Bible apps and is packaged as a lightweight, cross-platform desktop application using Electron.
